This work presents SuperClass, a super simple classification method that performs vision-language pre-training. Our method does **not require a text encoder** to be pre-trained on image-text data. Instead, it utilizes **tokenized raw text** as **supervised classification labels**, without the need for additional text filtering or selection.

## News

- **2024-11-06:** Paper & code are all released.
- **2024-10-02:** SuperClass is accepted by NeurIPS 2024.


## Usage

### Prepraration

```bash
git clone https://github.com/x-cls/superclass
cd superclass
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the datasets [Datacomp-1B](https://github.com/mlfoundations/datacomp) and [ImageNet-1K](https://www.image-net.org/download.php). You can also use [other image-text pair datasets](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#examples) for training.

Modify the **DATA_PATH** and **VAL_DATA_PATH** in training script **train.sh** and **train_combo.sh** to your local paths to Datacomp-1B and ImageNet-1K.


### CLIP Training & Superclass Training

To start CLIP training and superclass training, use the following command:

```bash
bash train.sh <config_path> opencls
```

This script will navigate to the opencls directory and execute the training.

If you want to include the LiT training phase, use the following command:

```bash
bash train_combo.sh <cls_config_path> <lit_config_path> opencls
```

CLS training config are here `opencls/configs/cls_schedule`


For example:
```bash
bash train.sh configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_b16_s1.28B_bs16k.yaml opencls
```

Please note that the default **precision** during training is set to **amp_bfloat16**. If your GPU (e.g., V100) does not support bf16, please change it to **fp16** or **amp**.
